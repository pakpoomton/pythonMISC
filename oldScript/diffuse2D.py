"""
A program which uses an explicit finite difference
scheme to solve the diffusion equation with fixed
boundary values and a given initial value for the
density.

Two steps of the solution are stored: the current
solution, u, and the previous step, ui. At each time-
step, u is calculated from ui. u is moved to ui at the
end of each time-step to move forward in time.
